## Introduction
Welcome to Stage 2 of the Experience AI Challenge! You're about to embark on a visual odyssey where we cross the landscapes of art, machine learning, and coding.

Ever wonder how your favorite photo app distinguishes between pictures of cats and pictures of dogs? It's all due to the science of image classification. It's like equipping your computer with a tool that allows it to process and tell images apart.

At the heart of this superpower is training your machine learning mordel. You have to tell it, “This is a hotdog. This isn’t.” Once it has processed lots of pictures, the model can use clues – like colour, shape, and size – to detect patterns in the data and classify new images into hotdogs and not hotdogs.

And here’s the super cool part: once you get the hang of it with hotdogs, you can teach your computer to classify anything! Your favourite sneakers, your coolest comic book characters, or even different types of dances! The sky’s the limit once you grasp the basics of image classification. So, are you ready to give your tech some awesome vision skills? Let’s dive in!

### You will

Using the Machine Learning for Kids platform, Scratch, and a whole lot of pictures, you will:
  + Build a machine learning model on Machine Learning for Kids
  + Collect text data of hotdog images and images of other things
  + Train your machine learning model on your collected images
  + Build an image classifier application that can detect hotdogs
