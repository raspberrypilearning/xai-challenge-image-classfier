## Introduction
Welcome to Stage 2 of the Experience AI Challenge! You're about to embark on a visual odyssey where we cross the landscapes of art, machine learning, and coding.

Ever wonder how your favourite photo app detects the difference between pictures of cats and pictures of dogs? It's all due to the science of image classification. It's like equipping your model with a tool that allows it to process and predict what is shown in an image.

At the heart of this superpower is training your model to find the right patterns in the data. The process of training a model is kind of like teaching a baby to recognise stuff. “This is a hotdog. This isn’t.” By training it on tons of pictures, the model starts detecting tiny clues — like colours, shapes, and patterns in the data.

And here’s the super cool part: once you get the hang of it with hotdogs, you can train a computer to classify anything! Your favourite sneakers, your coolest comic book characters, or even different types of dances! The sky’s the limit once you grasp the basics of image classification. So, are you ready to give your tech some awesome machine vision skills? Let’s dive in!

### You will

Using the Machine Learning for Kids platform, a pinch of Scratch, and a whole lot of hotdog pictures, you will:
  + Build a machine learning model on Machine Learning for Kids
  + Collect hotdog images and images of other things
  + Train your machine learning model on your collected images
  + Build an image classifier application that can detect hotdogs
