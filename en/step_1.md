## Introduction
Welcome to Stage 2 of the Experience AI Challenge! You're about to embark on an epic journey where we cross the realms of literature, machine learning, and coding.

Ever wonder how your favorite photo app knows which pics have cats and which ones have dogs? That's all thanks to the magic of image classification. Imagine giving your computer a superpower, where it can "see" and understand pictures, just like we do!

At the heart of this superpower is teaching your computer what to look for. It's kind of like teaching a baby to recognize stuff. "This is a hotdog. This isn't." By showing it tons of pictures, the computer starts picking up on tiny clues â€“ like colors, shapes, and patterns.

And here's the super cool part: once you get the hang of it with hotdogs, you can teach your computer to recognize anything! Your favorite sneakers, your coolest comic book characters, or even different types of dances! The sky's the limit once you grasp the basics of image classification. So, are you ready to give your tech some awesome "seeing" skills? Let's dive in!

### You will

Using the Machine Learning for Kids platform, a pinch of Scratch, and a whole lot of literary quotes, you will:
  + Build a machine learning model on Machine Learning for Kids
  + Collect text data of hotdog images and images of other things
  + Train your machine learning model on your collected images
  + Build an image classifier application that can detect hotdogs
