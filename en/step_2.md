## Create your machine learning model

Imagine you're trying to cut down on hotdogs and eat more healthily. This detector can help keep you on track by alerting you whenever a sneaky hotdog is on your plate! (In case you couldn't tell!)

First, create your machine learning model on Machine Learning for Kids:

--- task ---

Open the website [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/login){:target="_blank"}.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

In the screen that appears, choose **Log In** if your mentor gave you some login details. Enter your username and password on the next screen.

Choose **Sign Up** if you are creating your own account and follow the prompts to create a new account.

Select **Go to your Projects**.

Select **Add a new project**.

Give the project a name and set it to recognise **images**.

--- /task ---

Select **CREATE**. Once created, click on the project title.

--- /task ---


Now that you have created a project that identifies images, you need to set out the different ways your images will be classified - `hotdog` and `nothotdog` - these will be our **classes**.

--- task ---

Select **Train**. This will let you add new training data to your model.
